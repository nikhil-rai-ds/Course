Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Nikhil Rai 
Divide and Conquer Algorithms 
Through these algorithms I understood how breaking the big problem into smaller ones and storing there resuls helps us in reduced computation time. 
Some examples are Recursion,Binary Search
